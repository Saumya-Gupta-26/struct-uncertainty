# Topology-Aware Uncertainty for Image Segmentation
This repository contains the implementation for our work "[Topology-Aware Uncertainty for Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05671)", **accepted to NeurIPS 2023**. 

Full code coming soon!

Presently, the .ipynb file contains simple code on how to use discrete Morse theory (DMT) to generate the Morse Skeleton (and the corresponding critical points and manifolds)
